(  box-sizing: border-box; )
box-sizing *border box* indicates that any padding and margin values wont add more to the with.

for example,
padding-left: 2px;
padding-right: 2px;
width: 100px;

the following styles would result in 104px,
making u have to subtract 4px from the width by making it 96.

if you have box-sizing: border-box, u can run the following padding styles and still maintain 100px width without it adding the extra 4px.

DIVS ARE AUTOMATICALLY PLACED ONE BESIDE EACHOTHER, (IMPORTANT)
